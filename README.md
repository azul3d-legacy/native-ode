Azul3D native/ode package.

See documentation online:
  http://azul3d.org/packages.html#native-ode

This is a Go binding for the Open Dynamics Engine 3D physics library.  It
sticks fairly closely to the development version of the ODE C API, with a few
stylistic and idiomatic changes thrown in here and there where it seemed
useful.

ODE must be compiled as a shared library with double precision support.
Triangle mesh indices are expected to be 32 bit, which is the ODE default.  The
following will configure ODE with these options:

`> cd /path/to/ode-src; ./configure --enable-double-precision --enable-shared`
